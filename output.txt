@answer_3
I used optim() function of R in order to find parameters for logistic function: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function.
For the loss, I used L1 norm (absolute value of difference between the real datapoint and the predicted point).
While solving this optimiation problem, I used Nelder-Mead method as it does not require derivatives.
Initial value of x_0 is midpoint of given timeframe (104), L's initial value is maximum value of data, and k's initial value is 1.
