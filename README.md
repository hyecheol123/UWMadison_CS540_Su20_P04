Assignment Webpage: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yw/CS540P4S20E.htm
Repository for the 4th programming assignment of UW-Madison CS540 Summer 2020 course (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence)


## Goals
**Part 1**: Estimate parametric model describing the trend (Allowed to use package)
**Part 2**: Hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering


## Dataset
COVID-19 global deaths dataset from Johns Hopkins University: [link](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)  
*For this assignment, I retrieve data at Aug. 17, 2020 23:50 (UTC)*

### Data Preprocessing
- Combine the rows for the same country (e.g. US and Canada / data is reported by state)


## Tasks
- Data pre-processing
- Fit Parametric Model
- Hierarchical Clustering (Single Linkage and Complete Linkage)
- K means clustering

### Key Ideas of Implementation
